Iâ€™m a PhD student in the [Social Psychology Program](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon. My research currently focuses on how psychological interventions can be used to promote environmentally-responsible consumer behaviors. I have a passion for teaching statistics to all audiences in a way that is accessible and easy to understand. I am fascinated with the ways that data analysis can help us gain better insights into the world.
